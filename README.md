## Firebase Deploy

Steps to deploy to firebase:

- Make sure you are logged in using `firebase login`
- Run `npm run build`
- Deploy using `firebase deploy`
- To deploy web app only, add param `firebase deploy --only hosting`
- To deploy functions only, add param `firebase deploy --only functions`

## Firebase configs and secrets

This project expects theÂ `src/firebase-config.js` file which has been voluntarily excluded from version control.

The project expects the file to export the following firebase objects:
```javascript
export { firebaseApp, firebaseConfig, firebaseStorage };
```
Which should be defined and initialized in this file. These are initialized through the `firebase` and `@firebase/storage` libraries and require the firebase project configuration object available in the Project console, settings page.
